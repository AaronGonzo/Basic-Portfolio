            <p>I am an Arizonian and grew up in Phoenix. I went to Arizona State University for my Bachelors Degree in Tourism and Management with a minor in Special Events Management and it was then that I found a love for travel. After I graduated from University, I started my first job working at STA Travel as a travel expert. While working there I helped students go on an exchange program to my dream destinations, Australia and New Zealand. About a year of working at STA Travel I decided it was my time to take a leap and purchase a one way ticket to Fiji and Ausrtalia.</p>
